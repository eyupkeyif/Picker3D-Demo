Picker 3D Demo Project.

How to use Editor: On the top menu open Picker3D Demo>Level Editor. You can create level with "Create Level" button. There are 3 different types of tile to create a level. If you create it without any editing, it will be created with base order. (Normal>CheckPoint>Normal>CheckPoint>Normal>Checkpoint>Final)
You can select tile types, when you selecet a type a property related with it pops up under the tile section. For example: if you select "Normal Tile", Collectable Parent Type section appears under the section. You can also edit checkpoints amount which is required to pass that part of the level.
You can also edit or delete previous levels.
